#First of all you have to create a ssh key :
#ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "mail_for_backup@whatever.random"
#then, a hidden directory is created : .ssh, in /root/
#You have to create yourself the file authorized_keys. Be careful,
#the hidden directory SHOULD have the permissions as follows : chmod 700
#in the other hand, the authorized_keys file should have these : chmod 600

#At this point, you should link your own ssh key into the authorized_keys file.
#simply cat /.ssh/id_rsa.pub (containing your ssh key) >> authorized_keys.

#these are the steps to configure a server.
#but for this exercice, the answer is basically 

/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
